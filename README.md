# Cat vs. Dog Classifier Optimization

This project is a personal experiment aimed at improving a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying cats and dogs. The main goal was to explore how **Bayesian optimization** (BO) can be used to fine-tune both the architecture and hyperparameters of a CNN, leading to better performance.

## Key Aspects of the Project

- Implemented a CNN-based image classifier for distinguishing between cats and dogs.
- Applied **Bayesian optimization** to search for the optimal combination of hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, dropout rate, etc.) and architecture (number of layers, filter sizes, etc.).

## Optimization Strategies

  - **Grid Search**: Exhaustively evaluates all possible hyperparameter combinations within a predefined range, which is computationally expensive and inefficient for high-dimensional spaces.
  - **Random Search**: Selects random hyperparameter combinations, which is more efficient than grid search but still does not leverage prior knowledge from past evaluations.
  - **Bayesian Optimization**: Uses a probabilistic model (e.g., Gaussian Process) to predict promising hyperparameter values based on previous results, allowing for a more efficient and informed search.

## Advantages of Bayesian Optimization
- **More sample-efficient:** Finds better hyperparameters with fewer evaluations compared to grid and random search.
- **Adaptability:** Adjusts the search strategy dynamically based on past results.
- **Better exploration-exploitation trade-off:** Balances between trying new hyperparameter values and refining promising ones.

This project was conducted as an **experimental study** to better understand how Bayesian optimization influences CNN training and performance.
